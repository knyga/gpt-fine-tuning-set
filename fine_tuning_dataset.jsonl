{"prompt": "What is the difference between the `pages` directory and the `app` directory in Next.js?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The `pages` directory in Next.js, which is also present in previous versions, uses a file system-based routing and any file created inside of it will act as a route in the UI. For example, `pages/home.jsx` would take care of the `/home` route. \n\nThe `app` directory works alongside the `pages` directory to support incremental adoption and introduces the concepts of layouts, error components, loading components, and server components, among others. Routing with the `app` directory is controlled via the folders inside of it, and the UI for a particular route is defined with a `page.jsx` file inside of the folder. The `pages` directory is not replaced by the `app` directory, but instead, the two work together to provide a flexible and powerful routing system. END"}
{"prompt": "What are the differences between the old pages directory and the new app directory in NextJS 13?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In the old system, the pages directory was responsible for both routing and rendering. However, in the new system, routing is now handled via the file path each `page.tsx` is located in. The app directory is a route, meaning it needs its own `page.tsx` to render as an index at `example.com/`. As for the other routes, each is housed within its own directory, with the directory name being the route and `page.tsx` being its index that renders at that route. END"}
{"prompt": "What is the Metadata API in Next.js 13.2?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The Metadata API is a new feature in Next.js 13.2 that allows you to define metadata (such as `meta` and `link` tags inside your HTML `head` element) with an explicit metadata configuration in any layout or page that is a Server Component. The API is simple, composable, and designed to be compatible with streaming server rendering. Metadata configuration can be shared between layouts and merged/overwritten on a per-route basis. Dynamic metadata configurations are also supported. For example: \n\n```\n// Static metadata\nexport const metadata = {\n  title: '...',\n};\n\n// Dynamic metadata\nexport async function generateMetadata({ params, searchParams }) {\n  const product = await getProduct(params.id);\n  return { title: product.title };\n}\n```\n\nThe Metadata API is available in 13.2 for the App Router (`app`), replacing the previous `head.js` special file.

{"prompt": "What are the caveats of using the `app` directory in Next.js 13?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " There are several things to keep in mind when moving to the `app` directory from the `pages` directory. Firstly, there must be a file that defines the root layout at the top level of the app directory. Additionally, inside any folder in the `app` directory, you\u2019ll need to create a `head.js` file that will define the contents of the `<head>` tag for that folder. Also, every folder inside the `app` directory contributes to the URL path, but it is possible to opt-out of this by wrapping the folder name inside parentheses. Finally, by default, all of the components created inside of the `app` directory are React server components, leading to better performance due to a smaller bundle size, but if we want to switch to the client component, we need to specify that with the `use client` directive at the top of the file. END"}
{"prompt": "How can we specify the metadata of a page in the app directory?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " To specify the metadata of a page, we can export the constant `metadata` property in the `page.tsx` file, like so:\n\n```\nexport const metadata = {\n  title: 'Site Page',\n  description: 'This is the site page',\n};\n```\n\nIf we need to access dynamic data, we can use the `generateMetadata` function.

{"prompt": "What is server-side rendering and how can it be implemented in Next.js?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Server-side rendering is the process of rendering the initial HTML of a web page on the server before sending it to the client. This can improve performance and SEO of your application.\n\nIn Next.js, you can implement server-side rendering by using the `getServerSideProps` function in a page to fetch data on the server and then pass it down to the component as props. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\nimport axios from 'axios'\n\nexport default function User({ user }) {\n  return <h1>User: {user.name}</h1>\n}\n\nexport async function getServerSideProps(context) {\n  const { userId } = context.params\n  const res = await axios.get(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${userId}`)\n  const user = res.data\n  return {\n    props: {\n      user\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `getServerSideProps` function is making a request to an API to fetch the user data and passing it down to the component as a prop. This way, the user data will be available on the initial render of the component on the server, improving the performance and SEO of your application. END"}

This layout is applicable to all the routes in the app.\n- The `head.js` file is created inside any folder in the `app` directory, and it defines the contents of the `<head>` tag for that folder.\n- Every folder inside the `app` directory contributes to the URL path. Still, it's possible to opt-out of it by wrapping the folder name inside of parentheses.\n- Server components are enabled by default in the `app` directory, leading to better performance because of the smaller bundle size. But, if you want to switch to a client component, you need to specify that with the `use client` directive at the top of the file. END"}

The new features of `next/image` include shipping less client-side JavaScript, being easier to style and configure, being more accessible requiring `alt` tags by default, aligning with the Web platform, and being faster because native lazy loading doesn't require hydration. END"}
{"prompt": "How do you create routes with the new `app` directory in Next.js 13?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The new `app` directory uses the same file system-based routing as the `pages` directory. Like files inside of the `pages` directory, routing with the `app` directory is controlled via the folders inside of it. The UI for a particular route is defined with a `page.jsx` file inside of the folder. For example, a folder structure that looks like `app/profile/settings/page.jsx` will take care of rendering the `/profile/settings` route. END"}
{"prompt": "What is `layout.tsx` in NextJS 13 and how does it differ from traditional layout components?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " `layout.tsx` is a special file in the `app/` directory of a NextJS 13 project that serves as a built-in layout component. Rather than creating your own layout component and adding it to each page of your app, you can define a layout in `layout.tsx` and have it automatically applied to all pages. To use the built-in layout, you simply need to wrap the content of each page with the `<Layout>` component, like so:\n```\nimport Layout from '../app/layout'\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      <div className=\"container mx-auto\">\n        <main>\n          <div className=\"space-y-4\">\n            <h1 className=\"text-center text-5xl\">NextJS 13 Blog</h1>\n            <p className=\"text-center text-xl\">\n              Welcome to a dynamic markdown blog using NextJS 13.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </main>\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n```\nThe built-in layout is more powerful and efficient than a traditional layout component because it allows for the use of the `getLayout` function. This function takes a `component` parameter and wraps it in the layout. This can be useful for applying different layouts to different pages of your app. END"}
{"prompt": "What are Server Components in Next.js?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Server Components is a new architecture introduced in Next.js 13 that reduces the amount of JavaScript sent to the client, enabling faster initial page loads. With Server Components, we're laying the foundations to build complex interfaces while reducing the amount of JavaScript sent to the client, enabling faster initial page loads. When a route is loaded, the Next.js and React runtime will be loaded, which is cacheable and predictable in size. This runtime does not increase in size as your application grows. Further, the runtime is asynchronously loaded, enabling your HTML from the server to be progressively enhanced on the client. END"}
{"prompt": "How can I fetch data in Next.js for an ecommerce application?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " You can fetch data in your Next.js application using `getServerSideProps`.

For those using SWC, this was already supported, but now Next.js users can also take advantage of it. Here's an example of how to use `modularizeImports` in your `next.config.js` file:\n\n```\n// next.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  modularizeImports: {\n    '@acme/ui': {\n      transform: '@acme/ui/dist/{{member}}',\n    },\n  },\n};\n```\nThis transform would automatically convert the import statements to use direct imports, without having to write the code manually.

{"prompt": "How can we create client components in the Next.js app directory?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " We need to specifically define client components in the app directory. We can do this by specifying the `use client` pragma at the top of the file:\n```\n'use client';\n\nexport default function ClientComponent() {\n  return <div>Client Component</div>;\n}\n```\nWhen we use client components, we can use React hooks, Context, and browser-only APIs. However, we cannot use some Server Components only APIs, such as `headers` and `cookies`. Client components cannot import server components, but you can pass a Server Component as a child or prop of a Client Component. END"}

{"prompt": "What are React Server Components, and how do they work in Next.js 13?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " React Server Components are components in /app/* that serve as React\u2019s answer to the ongoing question of how to improve the hydration process in front-end apps. Much of the work in rendering components is handled on the server, so a minimalist, cacheable JavaScript profile is shipped to the client to handle reactivity. By assigning \u2018use client\u2019 in the file, the developer can specify that it\u2019s a client-side component, but this is not a default assignation, so developers must use the assignment in a specific Next.js folder to delegate client-side assignments to the file. END"}
{"prompt": "How can I define Layouts in the App directory of Next.js 13?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Layouts are foundational components that wrap pages in the new App directory of Next.js 13. To define layouts, we use the convention `layout.tsx` in the `app` directory:\n\n```\nexport default async function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang={'en'}>\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nLayouts are defined in the `app` directory using the convention `layout.tsx`. Next.js will automatically wrap all pages within the folder where the layout is defined. Layouts are useful to display a common UI across pages, but also to reuse data-fetching and logic. To fetch data, we can use the new `use` hook, an experimental hook in React that uses `Suspense` to fetch data on the server. END"}
{"prompt": "How do I create navigation links between pages in a Next.js application?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " You can create navigation links between pages in a Next.js application using the `Link` component from the `next/link` package.

The `app` directory introduces the concepts of layouts, error components, and loading components while also leveraging React\u2019s server components for building a UI. The directory contains several optional files, including `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, and `template.tsx` that allow you to define loading behavior, error handling, shared UI elements, and more. END"}
{"prompt": "What are the benefits of using server components in Next.js 13?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Server components in Next.js 13 lead to better performance due to smaller bundle sizes. By default, all of the components created inside of the `app` directory are React server components. However, if one wants to switch to the client component, they need to specify that with the `use client` directive at the top of the file. Server components allow partial rendering, which means that while moving between routes inside of the same folder, only the layouts and pages inside of that folder are fetched and rendered. END"}
{"prompt": "How can I use the NextUI Navbar component in my application?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " To use the NextUI `Navbar` component in your application, first import it from the `@nextui-org/react` package.

{"prompt": "What are React Server Components and how do they improve hydration in front-end apps?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " React Server Components are components in the /app directory of Next.js 13 that are handled on the server, providing a minimalist, cacheable JavaScript profile that is shipped to the client to handle reactivity. They are React's answer to improving hydration in front-end apps. When using client-side hooks like `useState` or `useEffect`, which the server can't handle, a `\u2018use client\u2019` directive must be added to the first line of the file to indicate a client-side component.

{"prompt": "What is the built-in module transpilation in Next.js 13.1, and how can I use it?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The built-in module transpilation allows for marking dependencies from local packages or external dependencies to be transpiled and bundled. This support replaces the `next-transpile-modules` package. \n\nTo use it, you need to create a `next.config.js` file then add dependencies to `transpilePackages`. For example, if you want to transpile `@acme/ui` and `lodash-es`, your `next.config.js` should look like this:\n\n```\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  transpilePackages: ['@acme/ui', 'lodash-es'],\n};\n\nmodule.exports = nextConfig;\n``` END"}

END"}
{"prompt": "What are Route Handlers in Next.js?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Route Handlers are a way to create custom request handlers for a given route using the Web `Request` and `Response` APIs. You can create reusable logic for custom route logic or abstract lower-level APIs to create these handlers.\n\nFor example, `route.ts` can export functions named after the HTTP verbs: `GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, and `PATCH`. \n\n```\nexport async function GET(request: Request) {}\n```\n\nThey offer the same level of flexibility as pages, including a modular route segment configuration, support for Static Rendering, and Revalidation. Route Handlers use the same route segment configuration as pages and layouts.\n \nA sample implementation to get a `token` cookie via a Route Handler:\n```\nimport { cookies } from 'next/headers';\n\nexport async function GET(request: Request) {\n  const cookieStore = cookies();\n  const token = cookieStore.get('token');\n\n  return new Response('Hello, Next.js!', {\n    status: 200,\n    headers: { 'Set-Cookie': `token=${token}` },\n  });\n}\n```\n\nRoute Handlers are available in 13.2 for the App Router (`app`) using the `route.ts` file. They are not available in the `pages` directory, as the API Routes replace them. \n\nFor more information, visit the [documentation for Route Handlers](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/route-handlers) on the Next.js website. END"}
{"prompt": "How do you create an error component in Next.js?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " An error component can be created in Next.js by creating an `error.js` file in the same directory as the components that can throw errors or in a directory's subdirectory. Whenever any error occurs inside the folder where this file is placed, the component will be replaced with the component defined in the `error.js` file. The `error.js` file automatically wraps the page inside of a React error boundary. You can also add an `error.tsx` file to isolate the error to the smallest possible subsection of the app. END"}
{"prompt": "What is the `app` directory?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The `app` directory is a new feature in Next.js 13 that makes it easier to lay out complex interfaces that maintain state across navigations, avoid expensive re-renders, and enable advanced routing patterns. It includes support for layouts, server components, data fetching, and streaming. END"}
{"prompt": "How can I set up NextUI in my Next.js application?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " To set up NextUI in your Next.js application:\n<ul>\n<li>Install NextUI by running: `yarn add @nextui-org/react` or `npm i @nextui-org/react`</li>\n<li>In your `pages/_app.js` file, import `NextUIProvider` and wrap it around your main `Component`. The `NextUIProvider` component needs to be initialized at the root level of the application, like this:\n  \n  ```javascript\nimport { NextUIProvider } from \"@nextui-org/react\";\nimport \"../styles/globals.css\";\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <NextUIProvider>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </NextUIProvider>\n  );\n}\nexport default MyApp;\n```\n</li>\n\n<li>Create a `_document.js` inside the `pages` directory and define a new `class`, which can be derived from the `Document` class. This class should define an asynchronous method `getInitialProps` to get the initial document properties. Inside the `render()` method of the class, wrap your `<Head>` component with `CssBaseline.flush()`. Your `_document.js` should look something like:\n\n```javascript\nimport Document, { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document';\nimport { CssBaseline } from '@nextui-org/react';\n\nclass MyDocument extends Document {\n  static async getInitialProps(ctx) {\n    const initialProps = await Document.getInitialProps(ctx);\n    return {\n      ...initialProps,\n      styles: <>{initialProps.styles}</>\n    };\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Html>\n        <Head>{CssBaseline.flush()}</Head>\n        <body>\n          <Main />\n          <NextScript />\n        </body>\n      </Html>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default MyDocument;\n```\n</li>\n</ul> END"}
{"prompt": "What is MDX for Server Components in Next.js 13.2? How can it be used?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " MDX is a superset of markdown that lets you write JSX directly in your markdown files. With 13.2, you can now use MDX entirely with React Server Components, meaning less client-side JavaScript for faster page loads, all while retaining the powerful capabilities of React for templating dynamic UI. You can add interactivity into your MDX content as needed.\n\nYou can use MDX with Server Components by changing the `@next/mdx` plugin to support an mdx-components.js file at the root of your application that provides custom components, like H1 and H2. Here's an example:\n```\nfunction H1({ children }) {}\n\nfunction H2({ children }) {}\n\nexport function useMDXComponents(components) {\n  return { h1: H1, h2: H2, ...components };\n}\n```\n\nNext.js also worked with community packages for fetching MDX content, next-mdx-remote and contentlayer, to add support for React Server Components.

Routing is now handled via the file path each `page.tsx` is located in, and each route is housed within its own directory within the app directory, with the directory name being the route and the `page.tsx` being its index render at that route. `layout.tsx` is essentially a built-in component for components that need to render on multiple pages. END"}
{"prompt": "What is Next.js and what are some of its features?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Next.js is a popular framework for building web applications with React. It provides a lot of powerful features out of the box, such as server-rendered React components, automatic code splitting, and easy-to-use development tools. With server-rendering, Next.js can improve the performance and SEO of your application. Automatic code splitting means that only the code needed for a particular page is loaded, resulting in faster page load times. END"}
{"prompt": "What is the benefit of importing modularized imports in Next.js 13.1?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The benefit of importing modularized imports in Next.js 13.1 is that you can leverage the `modularizeImports` option in `next.config.js` to avoid the compilation of unused files, resulting in smaller JavaScript bundles. This can be achieved with the `modularizeImports` option in `next.config.js`:\n```\n// next.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  modularizeImports: {\n    '@acme/ui': {\n      transform: '@acme/ui/dist/{{member}}',\n    },\n  },\n};\n``` END"}

{"prompt": "How can I create custom request handlers in Next.js 13.2 using Route Handlers?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " With Route Handlers, it is possible to create custom request handlers for a given route using the Web Request and Response APIs. Here's an example:\n```\nexport async function GET(request: Request) {}\n```\nA route.ts file can export an async function named by the HTTP verbs: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH. These functions can then be wrapped and abstracted to create helpers / reusable logic for your custom route logic.\n\nOther server functions, like cookies and headers, can be used inside Route Handlers, along with any Web APIs these abstractions are built upon. This allows for code to be shared between Server Components and Route Handlers.\n\nRoute Handlers are available in 13.2 for the App Router (app) using the route.ts special file. They are not available in the pages directory, as they are a replacement for API Routes. END"}
{"prompt": "What is the new feature added to built-in module transpilation?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The new feature added to built-in module transpilation is the ability to mark dependencies from local packages (like monorepos) or from external dependencies (`node_modules`) to be transpiled and bundled quickly.

{"prompt": "What is Turbopack and how does it improve performance in Next.js?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Turbopack is a new general-purpose JavaScript bundler that was introduced in Next.js 13. It is intended as a Webpack replacement and written in Rust, which gives it an edge in performance. Turbopack uses caching to improve the handling of source changes in an optimized way. The basic premise is that Turbopack holds a granular model of the changes that were already built and only builds those that are required to reflect ongoing changes. Every time source code changes are detected, Turbopack works incrementally by finding and building a changed code section, and incrementally updating the previous build. This significantly reduces build time, making development fast and efficient, especially for large-scale apps. END"}

With the `app` directory, you can use layouts to share UI between multiple pages, making UIs more dynamic and avoiding expensive re-renders. The `app` directory also introduces support for server components, streaming, and extends support for data fetching. You can incrementally adopt the `app` directory from your existing `pages/` directory. END"}
{"prompt": "What are the benefits of using the `app` directory in Next.js 13?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The `app` directory introduces several benefits, such as easier share UI between routes while preserving state and avoiding expensive re-renders. You can also nest layouts and colocate application code with your routes like components, tests, and styles. Additionally, it enables faster initial page loads with Server Components and uses the ability to progressively render and incrementally stream rendered units of the UI to the client with Streaming. Finally, it provides a flexible way to fetch, cache, and revalidate data at the component level with Support for Data Fetching. END"}
{"prompt": "How can I use MDX with React Server Components in Next.js 13.2?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " You can use MDX with React Server Components in Next.js 13.2 by adding the `@next/mdx` plugin and a special `mdx-components.js|ts` file at the root of your application to provide custom components.

{"prompt": "What do we need to keep in mind when using the `app` directory in Next.js?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " There are several things that we need to keep in mind when using the `app` directory:\n\n- There must be a file that defines the root layout at the top level of the app directory. This layout is applicable to all the routes in the app, and it must define the `html` and `body` tags because Next.js does not automatically add them;\n- Inside any folder in the `app` directory, we\u2019ll create a `head.js` file that will define the contents of the `head` tag for that folder. The component returned from this `head.js` file can only return certain limited tags like `title`, `meta`, `link`, and `script`;\n- It is possible to opt-out of the route group by wrapping the folder name inside parentheses. All the files and folders inside of this special folder are said to be a part of that route group. END"}
{"prompt": "How can I create a new route in the `app` directory in Next.js?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " To create a new route in the `app` directory in Next.js, you need to create a folder with the desired name and add a `page.js` file inside it. The UI for the particular route is defined with the `page.jsx` file inside of the folder. For example, a folder structure that looks like `app/profile/settings/page.jsx` will take care of rendering the `/profile/settings` route. To navigate to the new route, use the `Link` component from the `next/link` module. END"}
{"prompt": "How can I use Client components in Next.js?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " By default, all components created inside of the `app` directory in Next.js are React server components, leading to better performance due to smaller bundle size. However, if you want to use client components, you need to specify that with the `use client` directive at the top of the file. END"}
{"prompt": "How can we define a client component?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In the next.js app directory, we need to specifically define **client components**. We can do this by specifying the `use client` pragma at the top of the file, like so:\n\n```\n'use client';\n\nexport default function ClientComponent() {\n  return <div>Client Component</div>;\n}\n```\n\nWhen we use client components, we can use React hooks, Context, and browser-only APIs. However, we cannot use some Server Components only APIs, such as `headers`, `cookies`, etc. Client components cannot import server components, but you can pass a server component as a child or prop of a client component.

{"prompt": "What is partial rendering in Next.js, and how does it work?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Partial rendering is a concept in Next.js that allows for faster navigation between routes by only fetching and rendering the pages and layouts inside the current folder. This means that when moving between routes inside of the same folder, only the layouts and pages inside of that folder are fetched and rendered. It works by leveraging layouts and templates, where a layout can render another layout or a page inside of it, and a template component is mounted upon navigation, creating a new instance of the component and not preserving the state.

The component returned from this file can only return certain limited tags like `<title>`, `<meta>`, `<link>`, and `<script>`.</li>\n<li>Every folder inside the `app` directory contributes to the URL path. However, it is possible to opt-out of it by wrapping the folder name inside of parentheses. All the files and folders inside of this special folder are said to be a part of that route group.</li>\n<li>By default, all of the components created inside of the `app` directory are React server components, leading to better performance due to a smaller bundle size.

{"prompt": "How do you create routes using the `app` directory?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Routing with the `app` directory is similar to how you create routes with the `pages` directory. The UI for a particular route is defined with a `page.jsx` file inside the folder. A folder structure that looks like `app/profile/settings/page.jsx` will take care of rendering the `/profile/settings` route. The `page.jsx` file inside the folder controls the routing for that particular route. END"}
{"prompt": "How can dynamic routing be implemented in Next.js?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " To add dynamic routing in Next.js, you\u2019ll need to create a new file in the pages directory, and add a special syntax to the file name. For example, create a new file called \u201cusers/[userId].js\u201d. Inside the file, you can access the userId variable through the useRouter hook from the next/router package and use it to fetch data from an API or display information about a specific user. END"}
{"prompt": "How do I use the Edge Runtime in Next.js for API routes?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " You can use the Edge Runtime in Next.js for API routes by adding the following code to any API route file, such as `pages/api/hello.ts`:\n```\n// \"experimental-\" prefix is no longer needed\nexport const config = {\n  runtime: 'edge',\n};\n\nexport default function handler(req: Request) {\n  return new Response('Hello World');\n}\n```\nWith Next.js 13.1, the Edge Runtime inside Next.js is stable for API routes. When self-hosted, Middleware and API Routes using the Edge Runtime will run as a single-region workload by default as part of `next start`.

{"prompt": "What is the purpose of server components in the `app` directory?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " By default, all of the components created inside of the `app` directory are React server components, leading to better performance due to a smaller bundle size. This means that certain types of components are executed in a server environment using Node.js, allowing us to use Next.js's server features. But if we want to switch to the client component, we need to specify that with the `use client` directive at the top of the file. END"}

END"}
{"prompt": "How do you handle errors in the `app` directory of a Next.js v13 application?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " You can use the `error.tsx` file to isolate an error to the smallest possible section of an app. Creating the `error.tsx` file automatically wraps the page inside of a React error boundary. Whenever any error occurs inside the folder where this file is placed, the component will be replaced with the contents of this component, and the `<Error>` component\u2019s `error` prop value will be set to that error object.\n\n```\nexport default function Error({ error, reset }) {\n  return (\n    <div\n      style={{\n        backgroundColor: 'tomato',\n        color: 'white',\n        padding: 50,\n      }}\n    >\n      <h3>Error occurred:</h3>\n      <pre>{error && error.toString()}</pre>\n      <button onClick={reset}>Reset</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nInside `page.js`, you can now import the `ErrorBoundary` component and wrap the entire content within it.\n\n```\nimport { ErrorBoundary } from 'react-error-boundary';\n\nfunction Page() {\n  // ...\n}\n\nexport default function SafePage() {\n  return (\n    <ErrorBoundary FallbackComponent={Error}>\n      <Page />\n    </ErrorBoundary>\n  );\n}\n```\nThe above code defines the `SafePage`, a high-order component that wraps Page with an ErrorBoundary component. If an error is caught by the boundary, it will display the `Error` component. END"}

Additionally, you need to create a `_document.js` file inside the `pages/` directory, which extends the `Document` class from `next/document` and imports `CssBaseline` from NextUI. Here's an example:\n\n```\n// _app.js\nimport { NextUIProvider } from \"@nextui-org/react\";\nimport \"../styles/globals.css\";\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <NextUIProvider>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </NextUIProvider>\n  );\n}\nexport default MyApp;\n\n// _document.js\nimport Document, { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document';\nimport { CssBaseline } from '@nextui-org/react';\n\nclass MyDocument extends Document {\n  static async getInitialProps(ctx) {\n    const initialProps = await Document.getInitialProps(ctx);\n    return {\n      ...initialProps,\n      styles: <>{initialProps.styles}</>\n    };\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Html>\n        <Head>{CssBaseline.flush()}</Head>\n        <body>\n          <Main />\n          <NextScript />\n        </body>\n      </Html>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default MyDocument;\n``` END"}
{"prompt": "What is the `error.tsx` file in Next.js 13?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The `error.tsx` file is an optional file that isolates the error to the smallest possible subsection of the app. Creating the `error.tsx` file automatically wraps the page inside of a React error boundary, which means that whenever any error occurs inside the folder where this file is placed, the component will be replaced with the contents of this component. This file helps improve the error handling of the app by providing a clear way to isolate and handle errors. END"}

{"prompt": "What is the purpose of the `template.tsx` file in Next.js 13?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The `template.tsx` file is similar to the `layout.tsx` file but upon navigation, a new instance of the component is mounted, and the state is not preserved. This allows you to take advantage of a concept known as partial rendering. While moving between routes inside of the same folder, only the layouts and pages inside that folder are fetched and rendered. END"}
{"prompt": "What are the caveats of using the `app` directory in Next.js 13?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Some caveats of using the `app` directory in Next.js 13 include:\n- Mandatory root layout: there must be a file that defines the root layout at the top level of the app directory.\n- The `head` tag: we need to create a `head.js` file inside any folder to define the contents of the `<head>` tag for that folder.\n- Route groups: every folder inside the `app` directory contributes to the URL path, but it is possible to opt-out of it by wrapping the folder name inside of parentheses.\n- Server components: by default, all of the components created inside of the `app` directory are React server components, leading to better performance due to a smaller bundle size, but we need to specify the `use client` directive at the top of the file to switch to the client component. END"}
{"prompt": "How can we define layouts in Next.js13?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " We can define Layouts using the convention `layout.tsx` in the `app` directory. Next.js will automatically wrap all pages within the folder where the layout is defined. Layouts are foundational components that wrap pages, and can be used not only for displaying a common UI across pages but also for reusing data-fetching and logic. We can fetch data at the layout level using the new `use` hook, an experimental hook in React that uses `Suspense` to fetch data on the server. END"}
{"prompt": "What is the `app` directory in Next.js 13?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The `app` directory is a feature introduced in Next.js 13 beta that makes the routing and layouts experience better.

{"prompt": "What is the difference between Server Components and Client Components in Next.js?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " As their name suggests, Server Components are components that only run on the server and return compiled JSX that is sent to the client. On the other hand, Client Components are components as we know them today, and they run on both the server and the client. While Server Components are useful for rendering the skeleton of a page, Client Components are responsible for the interactive bits. Client Components can use React hooks, Context, and browser-only APIs, but they cannot import Server Components. Server Components can import Client Components. END"}

Every branch in your URL hierarchy can define a layout that is shared with its children, preserving state between transitions and avoiding the expense of re-rendering content in shared panels. Moreover, all components inside `/app/*` are React Server Components by default, and you can use the streaming render and suspense features with the `<Suspense>` component.

{"prompt": "What are the main differences between the old pages directory and the new app directory in NextJS 13?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The main difference between the old pages directory and the new app directory is that routing is now handled via the file path each `page.tsx` is located in in the new system, whereas the old system used a `pages/` directory to organize routes. Inside the new app directory, there are 3 special files: `page.tsx`, `head.tsx`, and `layout.tsx`. Besides these files, the new system requires that each route is housed within its own directory, with the directory name being the route and the `page.tsx` being its index render at that route. While the old pages directory is still available in NextJS 13 to allow users to slowly integrate their routing to the new file routing system, it can be deleted for starting a new project. END"}
{"prompt": "How can I build a server-rendered React app with Next.js?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " You can build a server-rendered React app with Next.js by using the getServerSideProps function in a page to fetch data on the server and then pass it down to the component as props.

{"prompt": "What is the new file-based routing system in NextJS 13?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The new file-based routing system in NextJS 13 allows you to create routes using the file system rather than having dedicated routes in `pages/`. Each route has its own directory named after the corresponding route and a `page.tsx` file inside it that acts as the index for that route. The `app` directory now acts as a route itself and requires its own `page.tsx` file to render as an index at the root of the application. Routing is handled based on the file path of each `page.tsx`. You can think of this new system like having multiple `pages` directories nested within each other, with each one making up its own route base.

It is not only useful for displaying a common UI across pages but also to reuse data-fetching and logic. We can use Layout components to load data needed in all pages in the layout component. For example, we can load the user's profile in the layout component and pass it to the page components. We can also redirect users to a different page, such as to a login page if they are not authenticated, from the layout component. END"}
{"prompt": "How can I use `useSession()` react hook to check the user login status?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " First, import `SessionProvider` and `useSession` from `next-auth/react` in the `_app.js` file. `SessionProvider` is used to wrap our component in a Provider which enables session state to be shared between pages. \n\nIn any component, you can use the `useSession()` hook to check the user login status. Here is an example:\n\n```\nimport { useSession } from 'next-auth/react'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const { data: session } = useSession();\n  \n  if (session) {\n    // user is logged in, render content\n  } else {\n    // user is not logged in, show login prompt\n  }\n}\n``` END"}
{"prompt": "How can I add routing to my Next.js application?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " To add routing to your Next.js application, create a new file in the pages directory with a `.js` extension, and add a special syntax to the file name to define dynamic routing. For example, create a new file called \u201cusers/[userId].js\u201d. Then, inside the component, use the useRouter hook from the next/router package to access the dynamic variable and display the content accordingly. You can also use the Link component from the next/link package to create navigation links between pages. For example:\n```\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router';\nimport Link from 'next/link';\n\nexport default function Navigation() {\n  return (\n    <nav>\n      <Link href=\"/\">\n        <a>Home</a>\n      </Link>\n      <Link href=\"/about\">\n        <a>About</a>\n      </Link>\n      <Link href=\"/users/1\">\n        <a>User 1</a>\n      </Link>\n    </nav>\n  );\n}\n```\nNow, you can access the content of the \u201cusers\u201d page at the \u201c/users/1\u201d path, and the \u201cusers\u201d variable will be set to \u201c1\u201d.

{"prompt": "How can I mark dependencies from local packages or external dependencies to be transpiled and bundled in Next.js?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " With Next.js 13.1, you can now mark dependencies from local packages (like monorepos) or from external dependencies (`node_modules`) to be transpiled and bundled. This built-in support replaces the popular `next-transpile-modules` package. \n\nHere is an example code block:\n```\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  transpilePackages: ['@acme/ui', 'lodash-es'],\n};\n\nmodule.exports = nextConfig;\n``` END"}
{"prompt": "How can I build a server-rendered React app with Next.js?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " To build a server-rendered React app with Next.js, you can use the getServerSideProps function in a page to fetch data on the server and then pass it down to the component as props. For example:\n```\nimport axios from 'axios';\n\nexport default function User({ user }) {\n  return <h1>User: {user.name}</h1>;\n}\n\nexport async function getServerSideProps(context) {\n  const { userId } = context.params;\n  const res = await axios.get(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`);\n  const user = res.data;\n  return {\n    props: {\n      user\n    },\n  }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the getServerSideProps function is making a request to an API to fetch the user data and passing it down to the component as a prop. This way, the user data will be available on the initial render of the component on the server, improving the performance and SEO of your application. END"}
{"prompt": "What are server components in Next.js?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Server Components are a new type of React components that run on the server and return compiled JSX that is sent to the client.

{"prompt": "What are Server Components?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Server Components are a new type of React components that run on the server and return compiled JSX that is sent to the client. They are useful for rendering the skeleton of a page, while leaving the interactive bits to client components. Server components cannot use browser-only APIs, React hooks or Context, but they can import client components. END"}
{"prompt": "What are the constraints of using Server Components in Next.js?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Server components cannot use browser-only APIs, React hooks or Context. However, they can use Server Components only APIs, such as `headers`, `cookies`, etc. END"}

{"prompt": "What is the mandatory root layout when working with the `app` directory in Next.js?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " There must be a file that defines the root layout at the top level of the app directory, which is applicable to all the routes in the app. In addition, the root layout must define the `<html>` and the `<body>` tags because Next.js does not automatically add them. If no root layout is defined, Next.js raises an error. END"}

{"prompt": "What is the Edge Runtime in Next.js?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The Edge Runtime inside Next.js uses a strict subset of Node.js APIs (like `Request`, `Response`, and more) which are compatible with Edge computing platforms like Vercel or when self-hosting. It is a light Node.js runtime for the edge, and is now stable for API routes. Middleware and API Routes using the Edge Runtime will run as a single-region workload by default as part of `next start`. On Vercel, Next.js Middleware and API Routes are deployed globally using Vercel Edge Functions for the lowest possible latency. END"}
{"prompt": "How can I use the app directory in my Next.js app?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " You can use the app directory in your Next.js app by first adding an experimental flag to `next.conf.mjs`:\n```\nexperimental: {\n  appDir: true,\n},\n```\nThen create the new `app` directory in your project directory and create a new file inside it called `page.tsx`. Copy the sample page from `src/pages/index.tsx` and paste it into the new `page.tsx`. Delete the `index.tsx` file to avoid conflicts, and also delete `_app.tsx`. Finally, import the `globals.css` file into the `layout.tsx` file to add styling. END"}
