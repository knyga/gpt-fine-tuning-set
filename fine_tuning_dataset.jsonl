It automatically wraps the page inside of a React suspense boundary, and the component will be shown immediately on the first load as well as when you\u2019re navigating between the sibling routes."}
{"prompt": "What is the purpose of the `template.tsx` file in the `app` directory?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "`template.tsx` is similar to the `layout.tsx` file, but upon navigation, a new instance of the component is mounted, and the state is not preserved."}
{"prompt": "Are there any caveats of using the `app` directory in Next.js 13?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "Yes, there is a mandatory root layout at the top level of the app directory, and the root layout must define the `<html>` and the `<body>` tags because Next.js does not automatically add them. Additionally, the components returned from `head.js` file can only return certain limited tags like `<title>`, `<meta>`, `<link>`, and `<script>`. Wrapping a folder name inside of parentheses opt-out of that folder's contribution to the URL path. Lastly, all components created inside of the `app` directory are React server components by default."}
{"prompt": "What is Next.js 13 and what are its new features?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "Next.js 13 is the latest version of the React-based framework for building web applications. Its new features include a JavaScript bundler called Turbopack, support for React Server Components and streaming rendering, the introduction of the /app directory for advanced routing and layout capabilities, and optimization improvements such as clever caching for handling source changes more efficiently."}
