      "A: Next.js 13 has been rebuilt from the ground up to be faster and more reliable. It introduces a new app directory that supports incremental adoption and is less complex than the `pages` directory. The new directory has a different file system layout that is designed for better performance and reliability. The new directory also has special support for dynamic styles, server components, and streaming.\n",
      "#4\n",
      "Q: How routing is different in Next.js 13 compared to Next.js 12?\n",
      "A: In Next.js 13, the `app` directory replaces the `pages` directory. This means that routing is handled via the file path each `page.tsx` is located in. Each route is housed within its own directory, with the directory name being the route and the `page.tsx` being its index that gets rendered at that route.\n",

Turbopack is written in Rust, which seems to be the go-to choice for systems-oriented tooling these days. Turbopack also has architectural changes like clever use of caching, which improves the handling of source changes in an optimized way.\n"

The new directory structure introduces new concepts like layouts, error components, and loading components, while leveraging React’s server components for building a UI. Routing in Next.js 13 is controlled via the folders inside of the `app` directory. The UI for a particular route is defined with a `page.jsx` file inside of the folder. A folder structure that looks like `app/profile/settings/page.jsx` will take care of rendering the `/profile/settings` route.\n",

The `app` directory is now stable and is the default routing path for Next.js applications. The `pages` directory is now deprecated and will be removed in Next.js 15.

The `pages` directory was used for dynamic routing and was previously included in the `app` directory as a special file called `page.js`. In Next.js 13, the `page.js` file is no longer needed and is automatically converted to a `layout.js` file.
